"""Mutation test for tools/omni_isolation.py.

A guard that has never failed is not a guard.  This injects an omni
declaration into every port - once into the library manifest, once into a
shipped source file - and requires the checker to catch each one.  It also
injects into the block that is deliberately EXEMPT (npm `devDependencies`)
and requires the checker to stay quiet, because a check that fires on the
correct tree is as useless as one that never fires.

Not ceremony.  In the struct port of this tool three source globs described
a layout that repo does not have, and all three reported "clean" while
reading zero files; a whole port was missing from the tables while the output
said everything was fine; and the devDependencies exemption inserted a
duplicate JSON key, so the injected entry was discarded before the checker
saw it and the case passed without exercising anything.  Only mutation found
any of that.

Every mutation is applied to a working-tree copy and reverted in a `finally`,
so an interrupted run leaves the tree as it found it.

Exit status: 0 if every mutation produced the expected verdict, 1 otherwise.
