# CORE, not a plugin, although only the plugins dial anything. The rule
# that a credential never crosses the network in plaintext is sekreto's
# rather than any one store's, and a custom provider written by a consumer
# gets it for free by calling `checkaddr` - which it can only do if the
# core carries it.
#
# A port of typescript/src/provider/addr.ts, which is canonical.

# precisely because the address carries a credential - so printing it
# verbatim wrote the password to stderr and into the logs. It cannot be
# cleaned up afterwards either: that password was never resolved as a secret,
# so redact() has never seen it and never will. The host is what a reader
# needs to identify which chain entry is at fault; the userinfo is not.

# Refuse to send a secret-bearing credential in the clear.
#
# A vault API is HTTPS in any real deployment; plaintext is a dev-mode
# convenience. Sending a token over http to anything but the local machine
# puts both the token and the secret it fetches on the wire for anyone on
# the path, so sekreto will not do it. Loopback stays allowed: that is
# `vault server -dev`, `boru vault serve`, and this repo's own test
# harness.
#
# The address is read by hand, in the same handful of steps in every port,
# rather than by each platform's URL parser. That is deliberate. Twelve
# parsers disagree about malformed input - where userinfo ends, whether
# `0177.0.0.1` is loopback, what an unclosed bracket means - and a check that
# answers differently in different ports is not a check. (Core Perl has no
# URL parser in any case - URI is not core, and this library takes no
# dependencies.)
#
# The rule this parse obeys, and the reason it can be trusted: it is never
# more permissive than the HTTP client that will dial the address. It ends
# the authority at '/', '?' or '#' only, so a client that also breaks on '\'
# (WHATWG does) can only ever see a SHORTER host than this does. It refuses
# userinfo outright rather than locating its end - which also settles a
# disagreement with HTTP::Tiny, whose own parse strips userinfo at the FIRST
# '@' where the RFC says the last. It compares the host literally, so a
# numeric form no parser here agrees on is refused rather than guessed at.
